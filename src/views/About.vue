    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
      The website is the outcome of a collaborative effort by R V College of
      Engineering students, professors, and management, with ongoing assistance
      and supervision from DIET Ramanagar and CWC. DIET Ramanagar is a premier
      teacher education and training institute. Caring with Colors is a
      non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the quality of education in
      public schools. The website is an aggregation of diverse learning tools
      such as PowerPoint presentations, charts, movies, activity sheets, working
      model demonstrations, and AR implementations that cover the EVS, Maths,
      and English syllabus for grades 1, 2, and 3. These tools have been
      designed to be as interactive as possible.
